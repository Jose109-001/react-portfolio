          The tech industry grows side-by-side with the increasing demand for
          web developers. Now, it requires more knowledge to fully understand
          everything that goes into creating a website or web apps. I have been
          working on the Pos industry for 17 years and I have realized that with
          the industry constantly changing, having someone well-rounded that
          knows all aspects of web development is important. Therefore, I have
          enrolled in this course so I can improve my skills for the future.
